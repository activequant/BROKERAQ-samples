Preconditions-------------I develop this with Python 2.7.3Windows users: We suggest you use Python(x,y) to run these samples. Please download it from http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/wiki/Downloads?tm=2  but of course any other python distro will do, too. You'll need protobuf. You can install them through pip. Using pythonxy, open an IPython(sh) shell and type "pip install protobuf". You'll need a valid user account with a broker from http://www.brokeraq.com Logging in----------Before you can do anything, make sure you have your login credentials at hand. Have a look at file ex_login.py to see an example of how to login.Upon login, the server will send you all open account values and working orders.
