Welcome to BrokerAQ's documentation!
====================================

Congratulations! You are about to use a great API for automated trading. We have put the entire APIâ€™s client side into public domain under GPL to foster and stimulate tool and system development. As a result, there are no licensing costs for using our API. 

This documentation site contains source code and instructions on how to use our API. It is  split into two sections: (a) use cases oriented, where we show how to do common tasks and (b) additional information and best practices.  

All code in this documentation is written in Python unless indicated otherwise. 

Please go through this site  thoroughly and share your feedback with us, so that we can improve our service and continue to work on Open Source Trading Software. 

See :doc:`important_classes`
